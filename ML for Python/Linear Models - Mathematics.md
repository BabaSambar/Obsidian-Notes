Comes under Linear_Model for [[ML in python]].
Linear_Model is used to predict values from a linear equation which is generated by the model in the form of **y = mx + b**, where m is the slope and b is y-axis intercept.
In Linear Models, inputs can be a single variable array or multiple variables. This is called as Multiple Regression

The optimal line for accurate results is found using calculating the **Cost Function / Variance / Mean Square Error** for the given inputs and adjusting the slope and intercept (coefficients) to lower the variance.

The following image shows the graph of Variance to the slope and intercept. The Variance is minimum at centre and slowly tends towards it.

For slope of Variance, its <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">partial derivative</mark> with respect to m and b is calculated.
![[Partial Derivatives of Variance.png|500]]
We subtract the product of <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">learning rate</mark> and the<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> derivative</mark> n times where n is the number of iterations a model has to go through. Usually the learning rate is in the range of 0.1 to 0.001 and iterations are in the range of 10000 to 500000.
We use **numpy** arrays for efficiency.
```python
def gradient_descent(x,y):
    m_curr = b_curr = 0
    iterations = 10000
    n = len(x)
    learning_rate = 0.08

    for i in range(iterations):
        y_predicted = m_curr * x + b_curr
        cost = (1/n) * sum([val**2 for val in (y-y_predicted)])
        md = -(2/n)*sum(x*(y-y_predicted))
        bd = -(2/n)*sum(y-y_predicted)
        m_curr = m_curr - learning_rate * md
        b_curr = b_curr - learning_rate * bd
        print ("m {}, b {}, cost {} iteration {}".format(m_curr,b_curr,cost, i))
