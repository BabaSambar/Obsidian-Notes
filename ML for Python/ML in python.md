<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Machine Learning in python:</mark>
	Giving correct relations between input and output which the model will familiarize itself with, and then providing similar inputs to get outputs generated from the model

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Libraries Used:</mark>
	SkLearn: Used for all models 
	Pandas: Used for preprocessing data, dataframe inputs, file input-output and efficiency over inbuilt functions
	Matplotlib: Used for data visualization as to co-relate input variables and their effect on output variable
	numpy : Highly efficient numerical data handling
	Joblib : Used to save models in local files (recommended for numpy arrays)
	Pickle : Used to save models in local files
