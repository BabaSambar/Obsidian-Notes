In [[SkLearn Library]], these methods are common to most models such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Linear Model, etc.
These are:

	<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">.score()</mark> : This takes input as x_test and y_test and tests the accuracy of the model.
	<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">.predict()</mark> : This predicts the output based on the input x.
