Kendall rank correlation measures the strength of dependence between two variable
It is an alternative to Pearson's correlation (parametric) when the data you're working with has failed one or more assumptions of the test.
**Kendall's Tau = (C â€“ D / C + D)**
Where C is the number of concordant pairs and D is the number of discordant pairs.
