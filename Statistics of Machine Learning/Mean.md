When we talk about the center of balance, which is the where the weights on either side are equal, we consider the mean of the dataset
Once we know the center of the data, we can draw inferences by determining the variance and standard deviation. Both these terms summarize the distance of the data from the central point. That is, if these terms have a high value, it means that most values in the dataset are distant from the mean, and so the data is heavily dispersed. However, small values mean that the data is closer to the mean, and so the dispersion is less.
