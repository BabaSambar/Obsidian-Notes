Pure water Ph=7. Water become alkaline due to hydrolysis of the salts that are present in the dissolved state. The commonly occurring alkaline substances in water are Ca(OH)2,Mg(OH)2,Mg(HCO3)2, NaHCO3, Na2CO3 etc.
Strong base: OH- and CO 3 2-
Weak base : HCO3-

Alkalinity in water neutralized by standard acid solution (HCl) to phenolphtalein and methyl orange.
Phenolphthalein Alkalinity due to OH- and CO32- whose neutralization can be indicated by phenolphthalein is called Phenolphthalein alkalinity(P).
After phenolphthalein end point only bicarbonate ions remain in water which are weak base.
If the same sample further titrated with standard acid solution using methyl orange indicator ,after comlete neutralization of bicarbonate then alkalinity obtained is called as METHYL ALKALINITY(M).
