2 types:
**A**. Temporary / Carbonate hardness:
Caused by the presence of dissolved bicarbonates of calcium, magnesium, and other heavy metals and carbonates of iron. Ex.: Ca (HCO 3 ) 2 , Mg (HCO 3 ) 2 , MgCO 3 , FeCO 3.
Temporary hardness is removed by boiling water.
At boiling temperature of water-soluble salts are converted into insoluble salts which are deposited as a crust at the bottom of vessel.

**B**. Permanent Hardness:
Due to the presence of chlorides and sulphates of calcium, magnesium, iron and other heavy metals. ex. - CaCl 2 , MgCl 2 , CaSO 4 , MgSO 4 , Ca(NO 3 ) 2 , Mg(NO 3 ) 2. These salts are removed by chemical treatment method, to make water soft.
**Total hardness**
The hardness due to all hardness causing salts is known as total hardness and it can be written as Total hardness = Temporary hardness + Permanent hardness

Unit of hardness:
The concentration of hardness as well as non â€“ hardness causing ions are usually expressed in terms of equivalent amount of CaCO 3. The choice of Ca 3 CO 3 in particular is due to its molecular weight is 100g (equivalent weight =50g) and it is the most insoluble salt that can be precipitated in water treatment.
	1. mg CaCO 3 equivalent per litre
	It is the mg of CaCO 3 equivalent of chemical in each litre of water.
	2. Ppm CaCO 3 equivalent; - It is the parts of CaCO 3 equivalent of the chemical per million (10 6 ) parts of water
