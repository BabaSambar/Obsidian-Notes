Rain water is purest form of water. Rain water falls on surface and various minerals dissolved in water.
(1) Dissolution of Minerals:
When rain water falls on surface at comes in contact with minerals like salt of sodium, potassium, lithium, these minerals are soluble in water. Than water soluble salt of heavy metal gives hardness character to water.
(2) Dissolved Carbon dioxide
Carbon dioxide present in atmosphere became soluble with water an form carbonic acid which come in contract with CaCO 3 , MgCO 3 on rocks ( limestone, dolomite etc ) the insoluble carbonates are slowly converted into solute and hardness causing bicarbonates .
eg. CaCO 3 +H 2 O+CO 2 → Ca (HCO) 3
eg. MgCO 3 +H 2 O+CO 2 → Mg (HCO 3 ) 2
(3) Dissolved oxygen
It can covert some insolate minerals into hardness causing salts
e.g. FeS 2 + 2H 2 O + 7O 2 → 2FeSO 4 + 2H 2 SO 4
