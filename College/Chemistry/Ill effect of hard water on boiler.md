Due to continuous evaporation of water ,the concentration of dissolved salt in boiler water increase. When their concentration reaches to saturation points, they are thrown out of water in the form of precipitate on the inner wall of boiler.

***SCALE:***
If the ppt matter form hard, adhering crust/coating on the inner wall of boiler is called as scale.
**Scale**:
	CaCO3 soft scales
	CaSO4 Hard scale difficult to remove
	MgCl2 soft scale
	Ca SiO2, MgSiO3 Very hard scale
Hard adherent coating on inner walls of inner surfaces of the boiler wall.
Scales are difficult to remove even with the help of a hammer and chisel. Examples: CaSO4, CaCO3, Mg(OH)2.
Reasons for formation of scale:
1. Presence of Ca (HCO 3) 2 in low pressure boilers
2. Presence of CaSO4 in high pressure boilers
3. Presence of MgCl 2 in high temperature boilers
4. Presence of SiO2
Disadvantages of scale formation:
1. Fuel wastage
2. Due to over heating of boiler, material become soft and increases of risk of accident
3. Reduces the efficiency of the boiler
4. The boiler may explode
Removal of scale:
1. Using scrapper, wire brush often
2. By thermal shock- heating and cooling suddenly with cold water.
3. Using chemicals â€“ 5-10% HCl and by adding EDTA

***SLUDGE:***
Sludge is a soft, loose and slimy precipitate formed within the boiler.
It can be easily scrapped off with a wire brush.
It is formed at comparatively colder portions of the boiler and collects in areas of the system, where the flow rate is slow or at bends.
It is formed by substances which have greater solubility's in hot water than in cold water, e.g. MgCO3, MgCl2, CaCl2, MgSO4 etc.,
Removal: Sludges can be removed using wire brush or mild acid.
Disadvantages:
1. Sludge are poor conductor of heat so they tend to waste a portion of heat generated.
2. -Excessive sludge formation can disturbs the working of boiler.
3. If sludges are formed along with scales : both get deposited as scales.
PREVENTATION OF SLUDGE FORMATION:
1. By using Well softened water
2. By frequently blow down operations- Drawing off a portion of concentrated water.
If the ppt takes place in the form of loose and slimy, it is called as sludge.
