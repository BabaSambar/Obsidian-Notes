Types of water:
a) Hard water b) soft water
Water contains more or less quantities of various salts dissolved. For industrial use, only the following mineral constituents determined, i.e., Ca, Ma, Na, K, bicarbonate, hydroxide, chlorides, sulphate, nitrate, fluoride, silica, Fe, Mn
The most important quality of water for industrial uses are hardness and alkalinity.
Hardness:- Hardness in water is that characteristic which prevents the lathering of soap .
A sample of hard water when treated with soap does not produce lather, but forms a white scum or precipitate. This precipitate is formed due to the formation of insoluble soaps of calcium and magnesium.
Soap is made up of sodium or potassium salts of fatty acid like oleic,
palmitic or stearic. 
Typical reaction of soap with calcium chloride and magnesium sulphate are as follows:

Thus, water which does not produce lather with soap solution readily, but forms a white curd, is called hard water.
Water which lathers easily with soap solution is called soft water.
