In practice magnetic circuit may be composed of various materials of different permeabilities of different lengths and areas.

**Total Reluctance:**

	S 1 = L 1 / Uo Ur 1 A 1
	S 2 = L 2/ Uo Ur 2 A 2
	S 3 = L 3/ Uo Ur 3 A 3
	Total mmf F = F 1 + F 2 + F 3
	 = phi S 1 + phi S 2 + phi S 3 = phi (S 1+S 2+S 3)
	Phi = mmf / S (total)

	S = L1 / Uo Ur1 A1 + L2 / Uo Ur2 A2 ...

	Thus the total reluctance of series magnetic circuit is equal to sum of reluctances of individual parts of series magnetic circuit.

**Total MMF**:

	Phi = N . I / S
	Mmf = phi . S
	S = S 1+S 2+S 3
	F = phi (S 1+S 2+S 3)
	   = phi (L 1 / Uo . Ur 1 . A 1 + L 2 / Uo . Ur 2 . A 2 + L 3 / Uo . Ur . A 3)
	As phi / A = B
	F = B 1 L 1 / Uo Ur 1 + B 2 L 2 / Uo Ur 2 + B 3 L 3 / Uo Ur 3
	As B / Uo Ur = H
	F = H 1 L 1 + H 2 L 2 + H 3 L 3
