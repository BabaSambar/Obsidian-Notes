Potential - Work done in bringing a charge from infinity to particular point is potential.
Potential Difference - Work done in bringing a charge from a point to another point is potential difference.

**Rules to decide direction of magnetic field.**
1. Right hand thumb rule:
	It states that hold the current carrying conductor in right hand such that the thumb pointing in direction of current and parallel to the conductor.
2. Cork - skrew rule:
	Imagine a right handed screw to be along the conductor carrying a current with its axis parallel to the conductor and pointing to the direction of current flow, then the direction of magnetic field is given by the direction in which the screw must be turned so as to advance in the direction of current.

**Laws of magnetism**
2 Fundamental laws of magnetism:
1. Like magnetic poles repel and unlike poles attract each other.
	This law is experimentally proven by scientist coulomb and hence also known as coulomb's law. 
	Force exerted by one pole on the other pole is directly proportional to squares of distance between them.
	Nature of medium surrounding the poles:
2. Magnetic field:
	The magnetic field is defined as region near a magnet within which the influence of the magnet is felt.
	The influence of a magnet i.e presence of a magnetic field can be tested by using a single compass needle or by using another magnet.

**Magnetic lines of force:**
	The imaginary lines of force around a magnet.

Magnetic #flux :
	The total number of lines of force existing in a particular magnetic field is called magnetic flux.
	1 Weber = 10^8 lines of force

Pole strength:
	Every pole has a capacity to radiate or accept certain number of magnetic lines of force which is its pole strength.
	Pole strength is a measureable quantity assigned to the poles which depends on the force between poles.
	If 2 poles are exerting equal force on each other they are said to have equal pole strength.

Magnetic Flux density (B):
	The flux per unit area in a plane at right angles to the flux is known as flux density.
	B = phi / A = Weber/m^2 = Tesla

Magnetic Field Strength / Intensity (H):
	This gives quantitative measure of strongness or weakness of magnetic field. Pole strength is different.
	The force experienced by a unit north pole with 1 Weber pole strength when placed at any point in a magnetic field is known as magnetic field strength at that point.
	Unit is N/Wb or Ampere/Metre

Magneto Motive Force ( #mmf ):
	The flow of electrons is current which is basically due to emf. Similarly the force behind the flow of flux production is mmf.
	Mmf determines the field strength. 
	It is the driving force behind magnetic circuit.
	It is given by the product of number of turns of magnetising coil and current passing through it.
	Mmf = N * I

Reluctance (S):
	Magnetic #reluctance is similar to electric resistance in electrical circuits.
	A magnetic circuit provides opposition to flow of flux.
	S = L / Uo Ur A, where L = length, Uo = permeability of vaccum, Ur = Relative permeability and A = area

S = mmf / phi = N * I / B * A

Permeance: 
	The #permeance of magnetic circuit is defined as reciprocal of reluctance.
	Unit - Wb / Amp Turns

Absolute #permeability (mu):
	The magnetic field strength H decides the magnetic field density B to be produced by the magnet around it in a given medium.
	The ratio of magnetic flux density B in a particular medium to the magnetic field intensity (H) producing that flux density.
	Mu = B / H
	Measured in Henry / Metre

Permeability of free space (Uo):
	If magnet is in vaccum, the ratio of magnetic flux density B to magnetic field strength H is called as permeability of free space.
	Value is 4 pi * 10^-7 Henry / Metre = 1.256 * 10^-6 N / m.

Relative permeability (Ur):
	Defined as ratio of flux density produced in a medium to magnetic flux density of free space under influence of same magnetic field.
	Ur = B / Bo where H is constant.
	It has no units.
	U (mu) = Ur * Uo
