2 Types of magnest:

	Natural Magnet
	Electromagnet

	Natural magnets are available naturally while electromagnets are obtained by winding a wire around a magnetic material.
	When current is passed through such a wire material behaves as a magnet.
	When a coil or conductor carries a current it produces a magnetic flux around it. It starts behaving as a magnet. Such a current carrying coil or conductor is called electromagnet.
	The flux produced and flux density can be controlled by controlling the magnitude of the current.
	The direction and shape of magnetic field depends on the direction of current and shape of conductor.
