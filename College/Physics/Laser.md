LASER - Light Amplifed Stimulated Emission of Radiation
Properties:
	Coherent
	Monochromatic
	High intensity
	Very less divergence
Coherent - Constant path difference
Stimulated Emission - The phenomenon of forced photon emission by an excited atom due to the action of an external energy is called stimulated emission.

Spontaneous Emission - Emission of a photon by an atom without any external energy is called spontaneous emission.

Pumping - Action of exciting atoms
Types of pumping:
	2 Level pumping - Not efficient. Used in semiconductors 
	3 Level pumping - Efficient. Meta-stable state exists (10^-3 s)
	4 Level pumping - Very efficient. Used in lasers.

Population inversion - Higher state electron population > Lower state electron population
