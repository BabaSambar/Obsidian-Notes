When a straight conductor carries a current, it produces a magnetic field along its length.
The lines of force are in form of concentric circles in plane perpendicular to conductor.
When the current is going into the plane of paper that is away from observer, it is represented by a cross inside the circle.
The current flowing through conductor that is coming out of paper is represented by a dot inside the circle.
