Holo - whole, Gram - writing
The process in which both the amplitude and phase components of light wave are recorded on a light sensitive medium such as a photographic plate is known as Holography.

The fundamental difference between a hologram and an ordinary photograph is like this.

	Photo is 2 D, Hologram is 3 D
	Ordinary light is used in photos but lasers are used in holograms
	Lens system is used in photos but lensless system is used in holograms
	Poor resolution in images of photos but high resolution in holograms
	Photos cannot be subdivided but holograms can be
	If the hologram were shattered or cut into small pieces, each fragment would still reconstruct the whole scene, not just part of the scene.
