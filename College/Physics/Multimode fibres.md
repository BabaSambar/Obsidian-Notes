Diameter of the core is less than 50μm -200 μm.
More than one mode can pass at a time.
A ray travelling along the axis is called axial mode. It has to travel smallest distance.
A rays incident on core cladding interface with an angle greater than critical angle are the higher modes. For the highest order mode and of incidence is greater than critical angle.
The distance travelled by different modes are different and hence, reaching to other end at different time. This is known as Intermodal dispersion.
Intermodal dispersion is undesirable and can be reduced by reducing the diameter of the core.
