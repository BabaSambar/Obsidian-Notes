In such fibres refractive index is maximum at the axis of the core, decreases gradually upto thecladding and the constant throughout.
The rays making an angle with the axis travel in curve line due to gradual decrease in the refractive index.
These rays travel longer distance than axial rays and they travel in the region of less refractive index and hence travel faster. This reduces the intermodal dispersion, hence used for long distance communication.
Core diameter is 20μm -100 μm. It can transmit more than one mode at a time. The cladding thickness is 20μm -25μm. these are called multimode step index fibre.
