A simple diode laser which makes use of the same semiconductor material on both sides of the junction is known as a homojunction diode laser.
A diode laser which makes use of different semiconductor materials on the two sides of the junction is known as a heterojunction diode laser.

We study single heterogenous lasers

Active medium - PN Junction
Active centre - depletion region
Pumping - Electrical pumping, forward bias

Active region - P type Ga-As region
Thickness of P type Ga-As region is 10 micrometres
Ga As:
	Band gap 1.4 ev
	Refractive index higher than Ga Al As
Ga Al As:
	Band gap 2 ev
	Refractive index lower than Ga As (for total internal reflection)
