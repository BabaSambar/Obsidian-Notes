In such fibres core is of single homogeneous transparent material of refractive index n1 and cladding is also made of another homogeneous transparent material of refractive index n2. where (n1>n2 )
There is a sudden change in the refractive index at core-cladding interface, due to whioch they are called step index fibre.
Core diameter is 50μm -200 μm. It can transmit more than one mode at a time. The cladding thickness is 20μm -25μm. these are called multimode step index fibre.
Due to intermodal dispersion they are mainly used for short distance communication for which intermodal dispersion is not significant.
The step index fibre with core diameter is 2μm -10 μm. It can transmit only one mode at a time. The cladding thickness is 20μm -25μm. these are called singlemode step index fibre.
They are used for long distance communication due to less intermodal dispersion.
