Magnetic circuits can be defined as the closed path traced by the magnetic lines of force (flux).
Such a magnetic circuit is associated with different magnetic quantities as #mmf , #flux , #reluctance , #permeability , etc.
This circuit consists of iron core with cross sectional area A sq. metre with a mean length of L metre.
A coil of n turns is wound on one of the sides of the square core which is excited by a supply of current I.
This current carrying coil produces #flux phi which completes its path through the core as shown in fig.
