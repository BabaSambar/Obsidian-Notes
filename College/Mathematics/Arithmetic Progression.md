****
**nth term of AP**
$a_{n}=a+(n-1)d$
where $d=a_{n}-a_{n-1}$
****
**Properties of AP**
1. If a constant is added or subtracted from each term of an AP, then the resulting sequence is also an AP with same common difference.
2. If each term of an AP is multiplied or divided by a non-zero constant k, then the resulting sequence is also an AP, with common difference kd or d/k respectively.
3. If a, b, c are in AP, 2 b = a+c
****
**Sum of n terms of AP**
$S_{n} = \frac{n}{2}[2a + (n-1)d]$
****
**Important results**
1. If $a^2, b^2, c^2$ are in AP, $\frac{1}{b+c}, \frac{1}{c+a}, \frac{1}{a+b}$ are in AP and $\frac{a}{b+c}, \frac{b}{c+a}, \frac{c}{a+b}$ are in AP.
2. If $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \cdots$ are in AP, $\frac{1}{a_{1}a_{2}}, \frac{1}{a_{2}a_{3}}, \cdots \frac{1}{a_{n-1}a_{n}} = \frac{n-1}{a_{1}a_{n}}$
****
**Arithmetic Mean**
1. $A=\frac{a+b}{2}$
2. $A=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}\dots+a_{n}}{n}$
3. Sum of $n$ AM's = $nA$ where $A=frac{a+b}{2}$
