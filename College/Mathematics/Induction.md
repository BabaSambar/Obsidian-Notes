**Principle of mathematical induction**
1. Let $P_{n}$ be a statement involving the positive integer n.
2. If $P_{1}$ is true and truth of $P_{k}$ implies truth of $P_{k+1}$ for every positive integer k, then $P_{k}$ must be true for all integers n.

**Strong induction**
Weak / Basic Mathematical induction assumes $P(k)$ is true, and uses that and only that to show $P(k+1)$ is true.
Strong mathematical induction assumes $P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}, P_{4}\dots P(k)$ are all true and uses that to show that $P(k+1)$ is true.
