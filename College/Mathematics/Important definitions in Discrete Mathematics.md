**Set:** A set is an unordered collection of distinct, unique objects.
**Subset:** Set A is subset of B if each and every element of A is an element of B.
If A is a subset of B and B contains elements which are not in A, then A is a *proper subset* of B.
**Power Set**: The power set of S, denoted P(S) is set of all subsets of S.
$|S| = n$ then $|P(S)| = 2^n$.
