If the limits of integral are not given then we find limits by sketching the region of integrals for given curves.

Steps:
1. Sketch the region given by the two curves
2. Find intersection points and region to find
3. Choose order of integration
4. Set up inner integral with limits of outer variable
5. Set up outer integral with constant limits
6. Write and solve the double integral
