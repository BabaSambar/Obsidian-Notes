The set with no elements is called the empty set or null set and is designated with symbol $\phi$.
A set that has one element is called a singleton set.
Set A is a subset of B if each and every element of A is an element of B.
If A is a subset of B and B contains elements which are not in A, then A is a proper subset of B.
The power set of a set S denoted by $P(s)$ is set of all subsets of S.
If $|S| = n$ then $|P(S)| = 2^n$

Intersection = AND = $\cap$
Union = OR = $\cup$

A multiset is a set where you specify the number of occurences of each element.

**$|A \cup B| = |A| + |B|  - |A \cap B|$**

**De Morgans Law**
$$
\overline{A \cup B} = \overline{A} \cap \overline{B}
$$
$$
\overline{A \cap B} = \overline{A} \cup \overline{B}
$$
