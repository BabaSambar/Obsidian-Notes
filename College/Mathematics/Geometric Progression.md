$a, ar, ar^2, \cdots$ is a geometric progression.
****
**nth term of GP**
$a_{n} = ar^{n-1}$
****
**Properties of GP**
1. If all the terms of GP are multiplied or divided by same non-zero constant, then the resulting sequence is also a GP with the same common ratio
2. The reciprocal of terms of a given GP also forms a GP.
3. If each term of a GP is raised to same power, then the resulting sequence also forms a GP.
4. If the terms of a GP are chosen at regular intervals, then the resulting sequence is also a GP.
5. If $a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},a_{4}\dots,a_{n}$ are non-zero and non-negative terms of a GP, then $\log a_{1},\log a_{2},\log a_{3}\dots,\log a_{n}$ are in an AP and vice-versa.
6. If a, b and c are three consecutive terms of GP then $b^2=ac$.

**Sum of GP**
$$
S_{n}=\begin{cases}
\frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r} & r<1 \\
\frac{a(r^n-1)}{r-1} & r>1 \\
na & r=1
\end{cases}
$$
$$
S_{\infty}=\frac{a}{1-r}
$$
****
**Geometric Mean**
1. $G=\sqrt{ ab }$ if a, G and b are in GP.
2. $G=(a_{1}a_{2}a_{3}\dots a_{n})^{1/n}$
3. Product of $n$ GM's = $G^n$ where $G=\sqrt{ ab }$
