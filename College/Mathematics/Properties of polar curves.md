**Property 1: Symmetry**
1. About initial line: If the equation of the curve remains unchanged by replacing $\theta$ by $-\theta$, then the curve is symmetric about initial line.
2. About pole ( origin ): If the equation of the curve remains unchanged by replacing r by -r, then the curve is symmetric about the pole.
3. About normal line ( y-axis ): If the equation of the curve remains unchanged by replacing r by -r and $\theta$ by $-\theta$ then curve is symmetric about y-axis, or by replacing $\theta$ by $\pi-\theta$, equation remains unchanged, then the curve is symmetrical about y-axis.
4. About line $\theta=\frac{\pi}{4}$ : If the equation of the curve remains unchanged by replacing $\theta$ by $\frac{\pi}{2}-\theta$, then the curve is symmetric about the line $\theta=\frac{\pi}{4}$
5. About the line $\theta=\frac{3\pi}{4}$ : If the equation of the curve remains unchanged by replacing $\theta$ by $\frac{3\pi}{2}-\theta$ then the curve is symmetric about line $\theta=\frac{3\pi}{4}$.

**Property 2: Region of absence**
1. If for $\alpha<\theta<\beta$, $r^2$ becomes negative, then curve does not exist for $\alpha<\theta<\beta$.
2. Find the least and greatest value of r, to get the bounds of the curve. If the least value of r is a and greatest value of b, then the curve exists in the annulus region $a<r<b$ only.
****
**Property 3: Pole and tangents at pole**
1. If for some value of $\theta$, r becomes zero then pole lies on the curve.
2. To find tangents at pole, put r=0 in the given equation of the curve, then the values of $\theta$ gives the tangents at pole. 
****
**Property 4: Points of intersection**
Find the points of intersection of the curve with initial line and line $\theta=\frac{\pi}{2}$.
Make table showing values of r for different values of $\theta$.
****
**Property 5: Direction of tangents**
Find the angle between radius and tangent by using formula:
$$
\tan \phi=r \frac{dr}{d\theta}=\frac{r}{\frac{dr}{d\theta}}
$$
****
**Property 6: Asymptotes of curve**
If $\lim_{ \theta \to \theta_{1} } r \to \infty$ then the asymptote to the curve exist and it is given by $r\sin(\theta-\theta_{1})=f'(\theta_{1})$ where $\theta_{1}$ is the solution of $\frac{1}{f(\theta)}=0$.
****
By considering all properties, draw the curve.
**Note:**
1. For curves having $\sin n\theta$ or $\cos n\theta$, divide each quadrant into n equal parts.
2. If we know the curve of $r^n=a^n\cos n\theta$ for any n, then curve of $r^n=a^n\cos n\theta$ can be obtained by rotating the plane through $\frac{\pi}{2n}$.
