**Property 1: Symmetry**
1. About x-axis: If x remains unchanged after the replacement of t by -t and y changes the sign, curve is symmetric about x-axis.
2. About y-axis: If y remains unchanged after the replacement of t by -t and x changes the sign, curve is symmetric about y-axis.
3. About origin: The curve is symmetric about origin if both x and y are odd functions of t.
****
**Property 2: Point of intersection with co-ordinate axes**
1. If both x and y become zero for some real value of t then curve passes through origin.
2. To find intersection with x-axis, find values of t for which y=0 then substitute in x.
3. To find intersection with y-axis, find values of t for which x=0 then substitute in y.

**Property 3: Nature of tangents**
$$
\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{\frac{dy}{dt}}{\frac{dx}{dt}}
$$
If $\frac{dy}{dx}=0$ for some t, tangent is parallel to x-axis at point (x, y).
If $\frac{dy}{dx}=\infty$ for some t, tangent is parallel to y-axis at point (x, y)
****
**Property 4: Asymtotes**
If $\lim_{ t \to t_{1} } x \to \infty$ and $\lim_{ t \to t_{1} } y\to \infty$, then $t=t_{1}$ is asymptote to the curve.
****
**Property 5: Region of absence of the curve**
1. Find the region where curve does not exist or where x and y are imaginary.
2. If possible, find the least and greatest values of x and y and draw the lines parallel to co-ordinate axes corresponding to these values. Therefore the curve lies in region determined by these lines.
****
**Property 6: Variation of x and y w.r.t t**
Construct the table for values of x and y by using different values of t.
