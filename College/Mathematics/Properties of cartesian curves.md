**Property 1: Symmetry**
1. Symmetric about x axis: If only even powers of y occur in $f(x,y)=0$ then curve is symmetric about x axis.
2. Symmetric about y axis: If only even powers of x occur in $f(x,y)=0$ then curve is symmetric about y axis.
3. Symmetric about both axis: If only even powers of x and y occur in $f(x,y)=0$ then curve is symmetric about both axis.
4. Symmetric about origin (Opposite quadrant): If equation of curve remains unaltered about origin when $x \rightarrow -x$ and $y\rightarrow -y$, curve is symmetric about origin.
5. Symmetric about line $x=y$ if $x\leftrightarrow y$ remains same.
6. Symmetric about line $x=-y$ if $x\leftrightarrow-y$ remains same.

**Property 2: Passing through origin**
If no constant term is present in the equation, it passes through the origin.
****
**Property 3: Tangent to curve at origin**
When curve is passing through origin then the tangent to the curve at the origin are obtained by equating to zero the group of lowest degree terms.
Example: In $y^2=4ax$, lowest degree term is $4ax$ hence $4ax=0$ hence $x=0$ is the tangent at origin.
****
**Property 4: Multiple/Singular point**
A point through which n branches of curve pass is called as multiple point of nth order and has n tangents. Thus at double point, two branches of curve pass.
_Double Point: Classified as a node or cusp or an isolated (conjugate) point accordingly to the tangents being real, distinct, coincident or imaginary._
1. Node: A double point is called a node if the tangents at two branches are distinct and real.
2. Cusp: A double point is called cusp if the tangent at two branches are coincident.
3. Isolated Point: A point P is isolated point if co-ordinates of P satisfies equation of curve but no branch of curve pass through it.

**Property 5: Asymptotes**
Asymptotes are tangents tending to infinity.
1. Parallel to x axis: Obtained by equating to zero the coefficient of highest powers of x in given equation of curve.
2. Parallel to y axis: Obtained by equating to zero the coefficient of highest powers of y in given equation of curve.
3. No asymptotes parallel to x or y axis: If coefficient of highest powers of x and y are constant or has imaginary factor in given equation then curve has no asymptotes.
****
**Property 6: Point of intersection**
For point of intersection of 2 curves put $x_{1}$ in $x_{2}$ and get common $y$ coordinate, and vice versa for x coordinate.
****
**Property 7: Region of absence**
If possible, express the given equation in terms of $y=f(x)$ or $x=f(y)$.
1. For $x>a$, $y^2 < 0$, imaginary $y$ then curve does not exist beyond line $x=a$.
2. For $y<-b$, $x^2 < 0$, imaginary $x$ then curve does not exist beyond line $y=a$.
****
**Property 8: Tangents as derivatives**
1. If $\frac{dy}{dx}=0\Rightarrow$ Parallel to x axis.
2. If $\frac{dy}{dx}=\infty\Rightarrow$ Parallel to y axis.
3. If $\frac{dy}{dx}=positive\Rightarrow$ Acute angle with respect to x axis.
4. If $\frac{dy}{dx}=negative\Rightarrow$ Obtuse angle with respect to y axis.
